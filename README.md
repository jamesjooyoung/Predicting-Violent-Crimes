# Predicting-Violent-Crimes

## Introduction

With the motivation of helping communities identify certain features that may influence their crime rates and better manage violent crimes, this project utilizes data on socio-economic conditions, police, and households to discover the best supervised learning model that predicts violent crime rates with least error and analyze the three most statistically significant factors. The dataset from UCIâ€™s Machine Learning Repository contains data on 1994 U.S. counties and 128 feature attributes. Previous research have built predictive models (clustering, KNN, etc.) for better crime prediction and hotspot identification and have found population age and police presence as key predictors.
